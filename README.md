# Retrofit V1 Example

A one screen demo app that uses the Retrofit library (http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to handle Restful API calls. To demonstrate this, the app makes a call to the tfl api https://api.tfl.gov.uk/line/mode/tube/status to get the status of all the tube lines in london. The returned status of each tube line is then displayed in a very simple Recycler View.

Please note this Retrofit example is for Version 1.9.+, since development Retrofit V2.0 has been released with major changes and so this example will not work with V2.0
